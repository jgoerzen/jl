Some of these properties have defaults;
which props are required depends partly on the contest.  
E.g., you need MultiplierList and MultiplierListBreak if the contest uses
ListedStringChecker, which reads a two-column list; you use maxZone and possibly 
minZone if you're using the enumerated checker (numerical multipliers from 
minZone..maxZone); you use bNNNpts for VHF contests, and pointsPer{CW,Phone}QSO
irregularly, depending on the contest's rules.  (PPQSO is used where possible, but many
HF DX tests have complex scoring rules that can't be summarized so quickly.)

Having unneeded properties in the list can make it confusing, but doesn't hurt
anything.

If a property is missing, JL can die in an hard-to-diagnose way 
(really need to fix that!)
