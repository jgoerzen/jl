<h3>Changes in JL since 1.0</h3>
<h4>1.04</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Support for Elecraft K2 contributed by Kevin Schmidt, W9CF
<li>
Supports Icom 756Pro series split-frequency operation.
(As a side affect, allegedly supports 7800, but untested)
<li>
Changed NASprintPhone configuration file to score correctly (1 point
per phone QSO).
</ul>
<h4>1.03</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Updated county abbreviations for California QSO Party (now using
standard 4-letter abbrevs)
<li>
Added "truncate leading zeros in serials" mode to keyer
<li>
Improved the (somewhat awful) list of allowed abbreviations for IARU
societies. 
<li>
Added in-state (resident) support for Texas QSO Party.
<li>
Eliminated "Rcvd" QTC button; in practice, it wasn't useful.  Send
disables the label for an individual QTC, but not the sending itself.  
<li>
IOTA contest name set correctly in cabrillo file.
<li>
DVK and CW keyer thread priorities set to MAX - 1.  This will (I hope)
improve keyer performance when load goes high.  (Keyer performance
proves NOT TO BE AN ISSUE when running on a machine that does DMA
correctly). 
<li>
Work started on cluster support
<li>
ARRL DX now scores W and VE QSOs as zero points ("out of bounds").d
<li>
Stew Perry fixed to ALWAYS put a 599 in the cabrillo file for each
side of the exchange.  The report can not be changed.  It is not part
of the exchange, but the contest management wants it so the file
parses correctly.  (Interesting--is it required for VHF contests, too?)
</ul>
<h4>1.02</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Function keys now play keyer messages.  (Both phone and CW).  ESC terminates 
the message that's playing.
<li>
Fixed serious bug in VHF contests; summary display not working, and 
exceptions thrown all over the place.  (Also, most contests 
props files not set up 
correctly).
<li>
Minor bug fix for AllAsia implementation; it would throw an (ultimately
harmless) exception if you entered the age before the callsign.  In theory, 
bug also affects WPX and any other contests that rely on prefixes for 
multipliers.  The bug was harmless but unsightly, and now gone.
<li>
Fixed serious bug in LZDX contest; used CQWW zone for sent exchange.
How did I miss that?
<li>
Supports rig control for the venerable Icom 765.  (And presumably
other older Icom radios.)  The 765 was missing the "swap vfo" command,
which I was using.
</ul>
<h4>1.01</h4>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
1.01 starts up a LOT faster.  Previous versions waited for a
TCP connection to a log server to time out.  This was intentional, but
very dumb, since I haven't gotten around to finishing the log server.
<li>
Some minor changes in the layout of the display; in particular, I've
twiddled the way new multipliers are displayed in CQ WW DX.  Country
and zone display on the same line; the one that's new is in <font
color=red>red</font>.
<li>
Log output to the console (except for errors) is now off.  I'm
tired of waiting for the giant log to scroll by.  There's no way to
turn it back on without touching the source code.
<li>
CW output to the console is likewise off by default.
CW output may be turned back on by
setting the property keyer.cw.showCWOnConsole to "true" in the
keyer.props file (in the configuration folder).
I find this is useful for checking a set of
message configurations.
<li>
Some major cleanup in the sanity of the code.  Unfortunately, not
enough.  One consequence, though: the multiplier.1 is now MANDATORY for
ALL contests, and multiplier.2 is mandatory for ALL contests that need
two different multiplier checkers.  This has NO CONSEQUENCE for users;
you'll need to know it if you try to work on the code.
</ul>
