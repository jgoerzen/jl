TRANSCEIVERS:

* When adding a transceiver, remember to add the transceiver to
  transceivers.txt 

* Note that the Transceiver instance is created by TransceiverFactory,
  which "knows about" all the transceivers.  An alternative would be
  to have a "class" property in the .props files.  (Actually, I like
  that better...)

* I've put ALL the (useful) Icom commands in Icom.java, not just the
  generic ones.
