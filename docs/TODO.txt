DX Cluster notes:

* n1mm has 30 minute aging on spots
* "old" spots with same call need to replace new spots
* Currently, using an ArrayList.  
  Ideally, we'd have a much more flexible data structure

Features needed:
  Integration with main UI
  Click on spot yields freq.  (And sets XCVR, possibly also logger)
  Do we *really* need to age spots (or just let them scroll off...)?
  Might be nice to coalesce identical spots
  Although you can change servers, not clear this works if a server
    connection drops or you're logged out.
  Filters (need to automatically send filters)


Cluster now has GUI;
Bombs out if you type an incorrect servername.  
    Is there a way to pre-qualify the servername?
And sparks come out under lots of other conditions, most of which I
    don't really understand.
  Are the "dead" threads really dying?  Not entirely convinced...

TODO list for JL:

ROAD MAP:

* Clean up scorer inheritance for contests with two multiplier checkers
* Work on exchange inheritance
* Reorganize MainWindow code
* Unify HistoryWindow and EditWindow in a JSplitPane?
* [FEATURE] warning light for "rig comm failure"
* [FEATURE] DX clusters
* [FEATURE] multi-op
* [FEATURE] direct submission via email

Contest-specific stuff:
* WAE: implement rcvd QTC?
* WAE: show QTC available for any given station?

More normal improvements:

* The COM port property is in the wrong place.
* should QSO files get time/band stamps?  (Or is having it in the log sufficient?)
  And if so, do you need a "read-only" mode, to prevent qso files from being 
  re-stamped when you're revisiting the log?)
* Currently, general log's per-qso file size limited to 1K; anything more is ignored.  
  Is this OK?  Don't expect people to be writing essays in their logs...
* Do we need some kind of mode that incorporates contest logs into the master log?
  (This is a pain, but it *would* help keeping track of contest QSLing)
* do a "post-contest" sanity check on the header
* implement more operation checks 
* proper scoring for single-band or single-mode operations
* NETWORK (multi-multi)
* Category overlays
* use same search syntax in all windows
* "in state" qso party (requires double listed string checker), with mobiles and
   multiple counties
* Tweak timer to start correctly (starts active, and changes to inactive on the
  first minute) and behave correctly when restarted at the *end* of a contest.

--------------nice to do sometime-----------------------
necessary to speed up re-dupe? (probably not)
minimize case flipping
